# nkitamuraQC

## Overview

We are developing software with the aim of automating first-principles calculations and enabling flexible integration with other computational chemistry tools. Our work spans a wide range of computational materials science and quantum chemistry topics.

## Main Projects

- Development of software for the automation of first-principles calculations and flexible integration with other computational chemistry software
- Property and correlation function calculation software for solid-state and molecular systems
- Development of software that bridges quantum computing and quantum chemical calculations
- Expanding the applicability of quantum chemistry methods
- Development of software for numerical linear algebra
- Collection and organization of various computational tools

## Ongoing and Private Projects

In addition to the above, we are also actively developing or exploring the following, though some are currently private:

- Computational chemistry software using tensor networks
- Quantum chemical calculations with solvent effects
- Chemical reaction prediction using deep learning
- Property calculation libraries based on machine learning potentials
- Materials database manipulation tools
- Mathematical study notes, including statistics and related fields
